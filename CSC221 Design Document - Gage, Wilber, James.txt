Stage 2. Design an Algorithmic Solution to your Project
Proposal.
Using Object-Oriented or imperative design methodology, plan a solution for the
project proposal. Express your solution as an algorithm using primitives like the
ones discussed in Chapter 5 of your text. You are certainly welcome to solicit
feedback from your instructor during the development of your design document,
but approval is not required.
