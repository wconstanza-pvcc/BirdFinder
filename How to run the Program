For the project to function you must use python version 3.11+ 
You must also use Visual Studio Code with the python version of your choice that must be downloaded from the microsoft store.
You should install the python extension for VS code as well 
Once in VS code you must open a terminal and run the following commands:

pip install customtkinter
pip install tkintermapview
pip install ebird.api
pip install dotenv
pip install threading

Additionally you must move the OSM file that is added in the repostiory to the path:
C:\Users\[Your User]\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\site-packages\geocoder
The python version will change depending on what you have installed, and to see certain folders in this path you also need to enable 'view hidden folders' on your windows file explorer
