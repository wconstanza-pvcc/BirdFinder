For the project to function you must use python version 3.11+ 
You must also use Visual Studio Code with the python version of your choice that must be downloaded from the microsoft store.
You should install the python extension for VS code as well 
You will have to create a folder somewhere on your computer and add all of the files from this repository to it. 
You will then open VS code and find the option to add a new folder (Found in the explorer tab)
You must then open a terminal, by going to view and pressing terminal, and then run the following commands, giving time to complete each action in betweenn:

pip install customtkinter
pip install tkintermapview
pip install ebird.api
pip install dotenv
pip install threading

Additionally you must move the OSM file that is part of this repository to the path:
C:\Users\[Your User]\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\site-packages\geocoder
The python version will change depending on what you have installed, and to see certain folders in this path you also need to enable 'view hidden folders' on your windows file explorer
