For the project to function you must use python version 3.11+ and you must use the built in funtion: PIP on your python interpreter.
you must run the following commands:
pip install customtkinter
pip install tkintermapview
pip install ebird.api
pip install dotenv
pip install threading
Additionally you must move the OSM file that is added in the repostiory to the path:
C:\Users\[Your User]\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\site-packages\geocoder
the python version will change depending on what you have installed, and to see certain folders in this path you also need to enable 'view hidden folders' on your windows file explorer
